* **VS Code / DBeaver / SQL Workbench** – SQL development environment

### 📋 Steps Included

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

   * Reviewed raw data in Excel
   * Identified null values and inconsistencies
   * Cleaned and formatted fields where necessary

2. **Database Setup**

   * Imported data into SQL database
   * Defined schema and data types

3. **Query Development**

   * Created SQL queries for core metrics such as total sales, profits, best-selling products, and customer distribution
   * Grouped data by region, category, and time

4. **Analysis & Visualization**

   * Aggregated and filtered data to derive insights
   * Used summary tables to highlight patterns

### 📈 Analysis Included
